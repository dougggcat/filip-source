SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL OF THE SKA BANDS/ARTISTS which i have referenced in this mod
SPECIAL THANKS TO @CASSIEBRAINROT ON TWITTER because their handle used to be @thelastskafan and they used to have a fnf profile picture, so they're basically the only person in the target audience for this mod
SPECIAL THANKS TO LYTE INTERACTIVE for making Funky Friday on roblox which is the reason i made this mod
SPECIAL THANKS TO PAPERKITTY who made the VS Kapi mod which i saw on roblox's Funky Friday once and made me think "ok im gonna make a fnf mod now"
